üöÄ Introduction
=================

When trying to wrap your head around design patterns for the coding world, it helps to take a virtual step back, and remove all thoughts of C, C++, Java, or [insert your favorite coding language here that for some reason is better than all the others because YOU use it] from your mind. The simplicity of the concept is in the words themselves. When you hear the words ‚Äúdesign patterns‚Äù break the meaning of each word up separately, and then combine. The word ‚Äúdesign‚Äù according to Webster‚Äôs Dictionary is: to create, fashion, execute, or construct according to plan. The word ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù according to Webster‚Äôs Dictionary is: a form or model proposed for imitation. 

Combining the meanings we get a construction of an idea that follows a model proposed for imitation. Continuing to keep coding out of our minds, we see this idea of design patterns applied in everyday life. Look at any major company within the world and look at their products design from year to year, for example, the Apple iPhone. You will understand the design patterns that are at work for every new model they roll out. Apple has a design that is similar from the years before, they follow an established pattern for their product because it is a model that works for their products for that year. Apple‚Äôs design patterns work for their recurring problems they face each year to roll out another product. Now, allow yourself to apply the design patterns definition to the coding world. If you have a recurring problem, you can design patterns that will be solutions to those very general problems, thus making your code more efficient and effective. It is important to note, design patterns are guidelines on how to attempt to solve your problems in general situation, not everything will take your design pattern and work.
