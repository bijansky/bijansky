In the world of science and technology, we all appreciate a good problem to solve. Weather you are an Engineer, Mathematician, Chemist, or Computer Scientist, just to name a few fields, we are all united as problem solvers. It is the core foundation of our fields of study to solve problems, and proper communication plays a huge role into solving all the problems we will be faced with.  

When one comes across a particularly head-scratching problem to solve, our fields of study encourage collaboration. This encouragement is really a push to ask questions from the recourses you have, and as the old saying goes “two heads are better than one”. Particularly in the world of Software Engineering, being able to ask your question in a smart way is highly important.  To illustrate this point lets first look at an example of a bad question.
