   In the world of coding I am still a complete newbie. With only three languages under my belt, Java, C, and C++, I am far from being a full-fledged programmer; I am more of a programmer in training. When learning all three of these languages, I found them to be very unforgiving and to me, not very intuitive for some concepts. I also found the syntax from some of these languages to be overwhelming for the first languages I learned. A year and a half into my Computer Science degree and I was never confident with my code, not until my first Software Engineering class, ICS 314, where I had to learn JavaScript.
