  Introduction
=================

<img class="ui large right floated image" src="/images/landing.png">
In the software engineering world, team programming is the backbone to computer software development projects. Working collaboratively on an array of individual sub-tasks, which add up to the bigger programming project, is the typical workflow of any software engineer. An effective team really helps to maximize each other’s in their own job performance, coming together to complete a huge project that would be an enormous undertaking for one individual. Software Engineers call this form of teamwork for coordinating task and distribution of workload, Project Management.

  Starting The App
=================

For my first ever software engineering class we were tasked to develop a web application for our final project. This was not an individual project, but one that we would accomplish in teams using Project Management. My team consisted of four members; Sean Motogawa, Justin Bishay, Seth Kinel, and myself. We came together to find a problem that our application could help others with. We all expressed how great it would be if there was a application for our university, University of Hawaii at Manoa, that allowed you to find a tutor for the classes you needed help in. We recognized that students have many obligations in addition to their studies. Many may not have the time to seek out the help they need with their classes. Office hours are sometimes too short, don't fit in the student's schedule, or are simply not enough. We aimed to develop the app Study Hall, which aims to solve this problem.

  Oh Boy, We Got Issues
=================

Using Project Management, we were all sub-tasked our own parts of the app to work on called “issues”.  These issues were our way of keeping track off what needed to get done and what was being worked on and what was completed. My issues addressed finding tutoring sessions offered by tutors from specific departments and classes. I created the pages and data that dealt with the different departments, classes, and sessions. From our landing page I created a tab that allowed you to go and see a list of major departments. From there you are able to select a department and view all the classes that are available with an available tutor and the sessions that are offered by the tutor. In addition to the department and class pages, I added little details into them to help students search classes in a more efficient way. I created a button that would sort the class list alphabetically by the subject name, or numerically by the course number.

  My Takeaway 
=================

During this project I learned a lot about software engineering and project management. Working on a big development project such as this I had the time to really practice my HTML and CSS coding skills. After this project I am moving past the beginner level with both and into more of an intermediate range. I really enjoyed being able to simulate a calibration such as real software engineers do. The project management skills that I learned from this project will be forever valuable to me as I continue my career in this field of study. I learned a lot about flexibility, communication, and even some conflict resolution skills when working with others on such a huge task. Overall I have a better understanding of what can make and break a project and what separates a group working together from a team working together!
