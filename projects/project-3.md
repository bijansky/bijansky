This project was about developing a game with a partner that involved everything we learned through the semester. Looking back the game we made, it was a very simple top down puzzle game. The user would control a character and be tasked to collect specific items hidden through the map in order to fix a broken robot and open a sealed door. Once the user collected all the items and fixed the robot the door would be opened and they would have beat the game. This project was massive at the time, even for two people. It involved the use of a RNG, being very proficient in for loops, while loops, if else statements, and being able to create our own map layout and work together as a team to meet our goals. My main role in the game was to develop the hit detection code and they layout and design of the map and its characters

This final project is something I will always be extremely proud of.  It thought be a lot about my own capabilities and the importance of using your recourses. I was always afraid to ask questions or show my weak points with coding. But with such a huge ask for my first semester coding I had to ask as many questions as I could and talk to a lot of people in my class, not only my partner. This has given me the best outlook and insight to what I am capable of with the passion I had developed for coding.
