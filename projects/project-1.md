This project was about developing a very simple collection game. The user would control a character and be tasked to collect specific items on the screen, while not run into others. Before this class I had no experience with coding. ICS 111 was a class I took to see what else was out there in the world, and what else my college had to offer. When this project was first assigned I was taken back because I could not wrap my brain around how to tell a computer to do what I wanted it to do. I had a rocky start, as it seemed like everyone else in the class had prior experience with coding, but in the end I was able to learn a lot from this project.
