summary: This collection project was the second project I was tasked with as an ICS student.

This project was about developing a very simple collection game similar to my first project, but now with moving objects. The user would control a character and be tasked to collect specific items on the screen, while not run into others. It was meant to refine our techniques with for loops, while loops, and if else statements. This was a solo project but I often was able to seek help whenever I needed it from other students in the class. 

My experience with coding was growing with everyday I had to work on my project. I went from nothing to something in a matter of a few weeks. Where at day one of class, I was scared if I could ever produce something. I really started enjoy the challenge and critical thinking that came with my assigned projects. Of course I would still see red lines in my IDE and have tons of bugs in my code, but at this point I knew that no one is perfect at coding, even those who have been doing it for years get bugs. I started to develop a serious passion for coding by the end of this project.
